This game is a stylized classic Snake, download it to get some pleasure, or to get usefull code snippets such as various menus, color/font/code_page/cursor changing in console, special input, that restricts you to input anything except digits, examples of Windows.h input methods etc. 

The main logic is in Snake.cpp. Lots of usefull functions are in PosControls.cpp, other files are diffrent pages with menus and game.

This is what you can change by options:

![mainmenu](./Menu.jpg)

This is how the game looks like:
